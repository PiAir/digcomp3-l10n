It describes knowledge, skills and attitudes that are needed to be digitally competent for daily life, participation in society, working and learning, and can be used with both children and adults. The framework is technology-neutral and is designed to be tailored and adapted for a variety of purposes in education, training and employment contexts. DigComp is intended for individuals and organisations, whether local, regional, national, European or international, which share the common goal of understanding and identifying digital competence needs and supporting their development. It supports EU policies and initiatives on digital skills (such as the Union of Skills, where DigComp is explicitly mentioned, and the Digital Decade Policy Programme) and the societal and economic implications of the digital transformation (such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Kids). DigComp 3.0 incorporates digital technological developments, trends and practices that have occurred since 2022, and which have wide-ranging implications for digital competence. It also includes a new section outlining learning outcomes which provides a more granular view of digital competence that allows easy and consistent interpretation and application of the framework, as well as the systematic and transversal integration of AI competence across the framework.",""

widespread diffusion of AI, the need for digital competence becomes essential for both personal and professional growth.

The Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) outlines the knowledge, skills and attitudes that individuals need to be digitally competent and operational in today’s world. Since its initial publication in 2013, DigComp’s comprehensive scope, scientific robustness and adaptability have driven its widespread adoption in employment, education and training initiatives at international, European, national, regional and local levels. It is also the basis for the Digital Skills Indicator (DSI) to measure digital skills in the European Union (EU) as part of the Digital Decade Policy Programme.

DigComp 3.0, the fifth edition of the framework, is developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in collaboration with the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL). Aligned with major European policies, DigComp 3.0 also integrates key rights and obligations under EU digital regulations.

This iteration introduces substantial content updates to reflect advancements in AI, cybersecurity, digital rights, choice and responsibility, wellbeing, and the need to tackle increased misinformation. These updates ensure that the framework remains relevant and comprehensive in defining digital competence. DigComp 3.0 includes, for the first time, a learning outcomes approach. This is a well-established policy and practical tool which helps to ensure that the framework is easily and consistently interpreted and applied. Additionally, a linked open data supplement enhances its interface with other machine-readable information, offering new avenues to analyse and bridge digital skills gaps across Europe.

This ambitious version of DigComp underscores the critical role of digital skills for all citizens in Europe, to ensure participation in society, learning, work and social inclusion.

The European Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) describes what is needed to be digitally competent in today’s society. This update of the framework responds to digital technological developments, trends and practices, and supports several EU policy initiatives on digital skills. As a generic transversal framework, it is non-prescriptive and acts as a starting point from which to develop, update, or evaluate initiatives that support the development of digital competence. In Europe, there is a clear need to prioritise digital competence. In 2023, only 56% of EU adults had at least basic digital skills, falling short of the 80% target set for 2030. Among secondary school students in the same year, 43% lacked basic digital skills.

Over nine in ten (92%) workers in the EU used digital technologies in their work in 2024-2025 and 30% of EU workers used AI systems in work in the same year. In 2024, 42% of EU workers reported an AI skills gap, yet only 15% had participated in AI skills training.

DigComp promotes a shared and common understanding of digital competence – knowledge, skills and attitudes for the confident, critical and responsible use of, and engagement with, digital technologies for learning, at work, and for participation in society. It is used by a large majority of EU Member States and beyond, as well as at European and international levels, to inform policymaking; develop assessments; enhance transparency or comparability of education and training courses; recognise or validate learning (such as through digital skills certification); and define profiles of digital competence in specific jobs or roles.

The first version of the DigComp framework was published in 2013, with updates published in 2016, 2017 and 2022. All versions of the framework are underpinned by a scientific evidence-based approach and consultation with experts and stakeholders. Similary, this iteration of DigComp has been shaped by scientific research and input and feedback from around 300 experts and stakeholders from a diversity of backgrounds.

This update responds to significant developments, trends and practices in relation to digital technologies that have occurred since 2022. It is shaped by five main priorities identified in expert and stakeholder consultations and policy and academic literature: AI competence; cybersecurity competence; rights, choice and responsibility; wellbeing in digital environments; and competence to deal with misinformation and disinformation. In addition, DigComp3.0 embodies the human-centric values of the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade.",""

These are further divided into 21 competences. Four proficiency levels (basic, intermediate, advanced and highly advanced) describe levels of progression. This iteration of the framework includes new and revised competence statements and over 500 new learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are statements for each competence that describe what an individual is expected to know, understand or be able to do after a learning process.

They are classified by knowledge, skills and attitudes. Competence statements do not distinguish between knowledge, skills and attitudes, but contain all of the key content of the learning outcomes. As the framework is already used by many stakeholders in various initiatives, the update reflects a balance between structural and conceptual consistency on one hand, and changes needed in response to digital technological developments on the other.

In addition to this framework document, readers can access the JRC-DigComp web space, which provides: a clear and user-friendly description of DigComp 3.0; an editable version of the framework;  a spreadsheet version, and a linked open data version (in JavaScript Object Notation, JSON format) of the tabular elements of DigComp 3.0.",""

In DigComp 3.0, the term ‘digital competence’ is used, to incorporate knowledge, skills and attitudes.

In response to the digital transformation and its implications for digital economy and society, the EU undertakes a range of actions and initiatives. Box 1 outlines some of the key ones.

Box 1. Some key European policy initiatives related to digital competence.

The Digital Decade Policy Programme sets out objectives and targets for Europe’s digital transformation towards 2030. In 2023, only 56% of adults in Europe had at least basic digital skills (European Commission, 2025a). The European Pillar of Social Rights includes principles related to education, training and lifelong learning. It is accompanied by a European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan (2021) which sets a target of 60% of adults participating in education and training every year by 2030. In 2022, this figure stood at 47%.

The Union of Skills (European Commission, 2025b) is an overarching strategy which aims to ensure that everyone in Europe is empowered to build solid skills foundations and engage in lifelong upskilling and reskilling. It includes an Action  Plan for Basic Skills (European Commission, 2025c) to address declining levels of basic skills (DigComp 3.0 is one of its actions), a STEM Education Strategic Plan (European Commission, 2025d), and a 2030 Roadmap on the future of digital education and skills based on a review of the European Digital Education Action Plan (DEAP) (European Commission, 2020, under which DigComp 2.2, the fourth edition of DigComp, was completed).

The Guide to EU Citizenship (European Commission, 2023c) contains information on rights and opportunities associated with being a citizen of the EU, many of which require at least a basic level of digital competence to access and avail of. The European Commission’s commitment to safer digital environments for all citizens, in particular minors and youth, is evident in the European Strategy for  a Better Internet for Kids (BIK+) (2022), which aims to ensure that children are protected, respected and empowered online. Other initiatives include an EU-wide inquiry on the broader impacts of social media on wellbeing and a European Action  Plan Against Cyberbullying.

The European Commission has also published the AI Continent Action Plan (2025) and the Apply AI Strategy (2025) which, alongside other initiatives, aim to promote AI literacy among all workers across sectors and to educate and train the next generation of AI experts (including multidisciplinary profiles), as well as attract European and international AI talent to work in Europe. The Apply AI Strategy encourages the adoption of competence approaches stemming from frameworks such as DigComp. The Commission is also working on an AI literacy framework",""

The AI literacy framework will be finalised in 2026.

Several European digital laws and regulations have been published in recent years. These help to protect the rights of individuals, as well as setting out their responsibilities, along with obligations of the providers of digital products, platforms and services. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2018) sets out principles, conditions and obligations for the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The European Accessibility Act (2025) aims to improve the functioning of the internal market for accessible products and services, including computers and operating systems, smartphones, banking and e-commerce.

The Cyber Resilience Act (2024) protects individual consumers and businesses buying software or hardware products. It introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements for the providers of these products. The Digital Markets Act (2022) gives consumers new powers of choice in digital services, data ownership and portability, streamlined access to services, and the right to unbiased search results. The Digital  Services Act (2022) helps to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, including the spread of disinformation. It regulates online intermediaries and platforms such as marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms. It ensures user safety, including children, protects fundamental rights, and creates a fair and open online platform environment. Guidelines for the protection of minors under the Digital Services Act have also been published by the European Commission.

The AI Act (2024) addresses risks to individuals’ health, safety, and fundamental rights in relation to AI systems. It provides developers and deployers with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI, while reducing administrative and financial burdens for businesses to facilitate innovation. It bans the use of AI systems that are incompatible with European values, while imposing requirements on AI systems that are classified as ‘high risk’. For all providers and deployers of AI systems, Article 4 of the AI Act mandates to ensure a sufficient level of AI literacy among the staff and persons dealing with the systems on their behalf. To support the implementation of Article 4, the Commission has published a Q&A and a repository of AI literacy practices from companies and public sector organisations.

The European Digital Identity Regulation (2024) mandates Member States to provide EU Digital Identity (eID) Wallets to citizens within 24 months of the Implementing Acts’ adoption. The European Media Freedom Act (2024) establishes the European Board for Media Services to promote effective and consistent application of the (revised) Audio-Visual Media Services Directive (2018).",""

DigComp 3.0, the fifth edition of the framework,4 continues to be the key reference framework for digital competence in the EU. Digital competence is one of the eight key competences of the Council  Recommendation on key competences for lifelong  learning (European Commission, 2006; 2018).

Key competences are knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed by all for personal fulfilment and development, employability, social inclusion and active citizenship.

DigComp 3.0 embodies the values of the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (European Commission, 2023a) which promotes a human-centric vision of the digital transformation.5 It is organised into six themes (see Figure 2). The Declaration builds on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (European Commission, 2012).

Figure 2. The six themes of the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles (2023).

People at the centre
Digital technologies should protect people’s rights, support democracy, and ensure that all digital players act responsibly and safely. The EU promotes these values around the world.

Solidarity and inclusion
Technology should unite, not divide, people. Everyone should have access to the internet, to digital skills, to digital public services, and to fair working conditions.

Freedom of choice
People should benefit from a fair online environment, be safe from illegal and harmful content, and be empowered when they interact with new and evolving technologies like artificial intelligence.

Participation
Citizens should be able to engage in the democratic process at all levels and have control over their own data.

Safety and security
The digital environment should be safe and secure. All users, from childhood to old age, should be empowered and protected.

Sustainability
Digital devices should support sustainability and the green transition. People need to know about the environmental impact and energy consumption of their devices.

Figure 4 summarises the objectives and key features of the DigComp 3.0 update, which are described in detail in Section 2 and Annex 1. The update to DigComp is driven by substantial technological developments, trends and practices (such as the rapid diffusion of generative AI) that have occurred since the publication of DigComp 2.2 in 2022. These have wide-ranging implications for individuals’ digital competences and are expressed in policy priorities and stakeholder concerns (Abendroth-Dias et al., 2025; Farias-Gaythan et al., 2023; Lewandowsky et al., 2020; Onesi-Oizigagun et al., 2023). DigComp 3.0 also responds to requests from existing users and stakeholders, who have sought more clarity on practical applications of DigComp. A key recommendation in a study on the feasibility of a European Digital Skills Certificate involving 650 stakeholders across all EU Member States was to develop learning outcomes for DigComp (Centeno et al., 2024a).

It includes information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, media literacy, digital content creation (including programming), safety (including digital well-being and competences related to cybersecurity), intellectual property related questions, problem solving and critical thinking.

Competences are defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes, where:

Knowledge is composed of the facts and figures, concepts, ideas and theories which are already established and support the understanding of a certain area or subject;

Skills are defined as the ability and capacity to carry out processes and use the existing knowledge to achieve results; and

Attitudes describe the disposition and mind-sets to act or react to ideas, persons or situations.

Box 2. Guiding notes and definitions related to DigComp

3.0 proficiency levels.

Each of the four proficiency levels of DigComp

3.0 includes (i) a short description of competence acquisition and (ii) the purposes that each level can serve. It is important to acknowledge that digital competence needs vary across individuals and change over time, due to life transitions and digital technological developments.

A task is a specific activity which involves the use of digital technologies that contributes to a goal, in any context – everyday life, work, or learning. Tasks can vary in size, duration and complexity and may be carried out individually or in collaboration with others. Tasks may range from simple to complex. In DigComp 3.0, a simple task is one which is well-defined, consisting of few parts, and easy to understand and complete. In contrast, a complex task is one which is not well-defined, consisting of many different and inter-connected parts, and therefore intricate and not easy to understand or complete. Complexity of a task is often described on the basis of task characteristics alone – however, the experience and characteristics of an individual undertaking a task are also relevant (Chen et al., 2023).

At Advanced and Highly Advanced levels of digital competence, individuals may draw on experience and/or specialised knowledge alongside digital competences to complete tasks. Here, specialised knowledge and skills refer to competences relating to a particular discipline, field or area.",""

These form the foundations of other competences, such as critical thinking and creativity, which are essential for participation in society, democratic life and the economy and/or labour market. The importance of basic digital skills for all individuals is also acknowledged by the United Nations (UN) Global Digital Compact (GDC), the first comprehensive framework for global digital governance agreed by UN Member States in 2024, which aims to foster an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital space that respects, protects and promotes human rights.

Several pre-requisites must be in place for an individual to be able to reach the DigComp 3.0 basic level of digital competence, starting with a level of literacy that is sufficient to decode basic visual, textual and/or audio information. Other pre- requisites include access to a sufficiently fast and stable internet connection; access to one or more suitable digital devices to connect to the internet which have the applications required by the user; to technical assistance, where needed; and to appropriate guidance and support, if needed, to adapt devices and settings to individual physical, cognitive or psychological needs (ITU, 2022).

It is important that initiatives designed to support basic digital competence development include a consideration of what is needed by individuals to access and participate in learning to reach basic digital competence as it is described in DigComp 3.0. If this is not considered, digital exclusion may widen, or the initiative may exclude certain groups and individuals. As an example, Austria includes an Area 0, Foundations, Access and Digital Understanding, in its national adaptation of DigComp, DigComp 2.3 AT (Nárosy et al., 2022).

The term ‘learning outcomes’ in DigComp 3.0 refers to intended, not achieved, learning outcomes. Features of the DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes, practical considerations for their usage, and the full set of DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes themselves, are in Annex 2.

In Annex 2, learning outcomes are grouped by competence, proficiency level, and knowledge, skill or attitude. In total, there are 523 learning outcomes: 29% (151) are at the Basic level, 32% (170) Intermediate, 23% (119) Advanced and 16% (83) Highly advanced. Also, 42% (217) of the learning outcomes relate to knowledge, 38% (199) to skills, and 20% (107) to attitudes.

Section 3 shows competence statements for each competence and proficiency level (see also Section 2.4). The competence statements contain the content of the learning outcomes in Annex 2, with a lot of commonality in wording, but do not distinguish between knowledge, skills or attitudes.

Learning outcomes are an important policy and practical tool. Used well, they act as the ‘glue’ that joins education and training with labour market contexts (Cedefop, 2024a). They influence policy, education, training, assessment and the labour market in a range of ways – to guide curriculum or course content development, implementation and revision; as a reference point for the recognition and validation of formal, non- formal and informal learning; to define and inform qualifications frameworks and standards; to support summative and formative assessment; to signal key employment skills in occupational profiling; and to contribute to sectoral needs analysis (Cedefop, 2017, 2022, 2024a).

The development of learning outcomes in DigComp 3.0 builds on extensive existing work on learning outcomes at European level (e.g. Cedefop, 2017, 2021, 2022, 2024a; Council of the EU, 2017). They aim to provide a practical way of integrating the DigComp competences into existing or new policies, training material or curricula development, amongst others.

It is important to distinguish between intended and achieved learning outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are statements of what an individual is expected to know, understand or be able to do after completion of a learning process. They relate to principles and concepts and might be observed in curricula, qualifications descriptions and standards. Achieved learning outcomes are what an individual is able to demonstrate after completion of a learning process. They are related to practice and are the result of an education or training and assessment process (Cedefop, 2022)",""

AI competence is intertwined with and builds on other elements of digital competence, as AI systems are widely diffused, and increasingly embedded within existing digital technologies. In DigComp 3.0, AI is framed as one digital technology among a range of digital technologies, while keeping the focus on the digital competences themselves.

Several definitions and analyses of AI literacy have been proposed, from the literature (e.g. Touretzky et al. 2019, 2023; Long & Magerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021); legislation (the 2024 AI Act, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689); recent AI literacy frameworks (e.g. OECD, 2025; Mills et al., 2024; UNESCO, 2024); and policy reports (e.g. Miao et al., 2022; Di Vinadio et al., 2022). These various sources emphasise conceptual understanding of what AI is (and is not), contexts for its application, and critical, ethical and responsible approaches to using AI. These features are reflected in DigComp 3.0.

To ensure that AI competence is well-integrated in DigComp 3.0, the JRC, with experts, has undertaken a review of recent and emerging digital technology trends and a mapping between the competences of the (draft) European Commission-OECD AI literacy framework (OECD, 2025) and DigComp 3.0 (see Annex 3 for more detail).

In DigComp 3.0, we define AI as per the AI Act (Article 3(1)):

...a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers from the input it receives how to generate output, such as predictions, content, recommendations or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. This definition takes a lifecycle perspective, covering both pre-deployment and deployment

In DigComp 3.0, the terms ‘AI’ and ‘AI system’ are used in their broad sense and include generative AI (systems). However, reference to generative AI in DigComp 3.0 is made when it is considered to be of central relevance to a competence. In DigComp 3.0, generative AI is defined as a subset of AI that uses specialised machine learning models designed to produce a wide and general variety of outputs, capable of a range of tasks and applications, such as generating text, image or audio (Abendroth-Dias et al., 2025).

Competence statements (in Section 3) which explicitly mention AI systems are labelled ‘[AI-E]’ (AI-explicit), while those for which AI or AI systems are implicitly relevant but that do not explicitly mention AI systems are labelled ‘[AI-I]’ (AI-implicit). Similarly, individual learning outcomes (Annex 2) are labelled as being AI-Explicit, AI-Implicit, or AI not Implicit or Explicit.

Box 3 provides more information on the meaning of AI-explicit and AI-implicit in DigComp 3.0.",""
"doc.digcomp-3-0-framework-components/ai-competence-in-digcomp-3-0.para.p0284-p0296.6495b893f3","section=digcomp-3-0-framework-components/ai-competence-in-digcomp-3-0;kind=paragraph_block;span=p284-p296;hash=6495b893f3","Box 3. Explicit and implicit AI competence in DigComp 3.0.

DigComp 3.0 distinguishes between AI-explicit and AI-implicit competences in the competence statements and the learning outcomes. Of the 362 competence statements in DigComp 3.0 (Section 3), 14% (50) are AI-explicit, 68% (246) are AI-implicit, and 18% (67) do not implicitly or explicitly feature AI. Of the 523 learning outcomes in DigComp 3.0 (Annex 2), 13% (69) are AI-explicit, 63% (330) are AI-implicit, and 24% (124) do not implicitly or explicitly feature AI.

AI competence features explicitly, implicitly, or both, across all 21 competences. This demonstrates the transversal impact of AI systems on digital competence. The aspects of competences which do not explicitly or implicitly feature AI are those involving digital technologies other than AI or which are inherently ‘human’, requiring attributes such as choice, preferences or situational judgement.

AI labelling of competence statements in Section 3 and learning outcomes in Annex 2 as AI-explicit or AI-implicit is intended as a broad guide only.

AI-explicit or [AI-E] means that AI systems are explicitly relevant to that competence. Meanwhile, AI-implicit or [AI-I] applies to competences for one or more of four reasons. The competence statement or learning outcome could:

Involve the use of AI systems as one of several available digital technologies

Example (see Section 3, Competence statement 2.2.08): A person is trying to decide whether or not to use an AI system for a content creation task. To do so, they need to establish what output is desired and consider the added benefits of using an AI system over another digital technology.

Involve the use of a digital technology that has AI system functionality embedded in it

Example (see Section 3, Competence statement 2.4.08): A collaboration tool has an AI-driven note-taking function. A person needs to decide whether or not to use it for a meeting. To do so, they need to consider what kind of meeting record is needed, and what benefits the AI-driven note-taking function might provide over and above a human taking notes.

Relate to an understanding of how AI systems operate

Example (see Section 3, Competence statement 2.1.14): A person has a long text to read and is considering using an AI system to help provide a summary. If they decide to use AI, they need to select an appropriate AI tool. They also need to be competent in devising appropriate inputs or commands (prompts), experiment with and re-draft both the prompt(s) and output(s), and check the quality and accuracy of the output.

Table A2 shows all changes to the titles and descriptors of the competence areas and the competences, together with a short rationale for the changes. Deletions are in strikethrough; additions are underlined; rationale is in blue font. The changes are mainly driven by a need to update the language and content of the framework to reflect digital technological developments and priorities which have emerged since DigComp 2.2. Changes are also made for clarity and overall framework consistency. Changes have been reviewed by experts and were subject to stakeholder consultation.

Rationale: Protecting is replaced by Supporting to convey a balanced and optimistic (but not naïve) perspective. ‘Wellbeing’ is understood in DigComp 3.0 to include physical, mental and social aspects, so Health is removed from the title.
To use digital technologies in ways that support wellbeing and inclusion. To be able to avoid health risks and threats to physical and psy- chological wellbeing minimise risks and threats to physical, mental and social wellbeing of oneself and others while using digital technol- ogies. To balance usage of digital technologies with offline activities to support wellbeing. To be able to protect oneself and others take  action to help protect oneself and others from possible dangers in digital environments (e.g. cyberbullying, harmful content), and to know  how to respond to such dangers. To be aware of digital technologies for social wellbeing and social inclusion.
Rationale: Using digital technologies in ways that support (rather than negatively affect) wellbeing and inclusion is added to convey the potential benefits of balanced and informed usage. Total avoidance of risks and threats to wellbeing may be unrealistic – this is replaced with minimising risks and threats, and not only to oneself but to others.

Table A5 lists examples of verbs for learning outcomes describing knowledge, skills and attitudes at Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and Highly Advanced levels. The choice of verbs is guided by Bloom’s taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001), considering also relevant features of other taxonomies (e.g. Irvine, 2021). Some verbs repeat across levels in Table A5. This is intentional, since the content of learning outcomes does not only vary by cognitive demand (which is suggested by the verb) but also varies in level of complexity and autonomy (which are suggested in the object of each learning outcome statement). Box A1 summarises the main features of the DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes.

No Knowledge-based learning outcomes are included in the Highly Advanced level. Rather, the Attitudinal learning outcomes at Highly Advanced level capture a general disposition to staying informed about developments in relation to that competence, in line with the literature on self-directed learning (e.g. Morris, 2023).

Box A1: Main features of DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes.

There are 523 learning outcomes in total. The number of learning outcomes varies across competences.

DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes are each linked to one proficiency level (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Highly Advanced), and are grouped by Competence and whether they refer to Knowledge, Skill or Attitude. They are each labelled as AI-explicit, AI-implicit, or neither AI-explicit or AI-implicit, which is intended as a general guide only. See Section 2.6 for more information on how to interpret the AI labels.

There are more learning outcomes at the lower two proficiency levels: 29% (151) are Basic, 32% (170) are Intermediate, 23% (119) are Advanced and 16% (83) are Highly Advanced. As digital competence becomes more advanced, the complexity of tasks and range of digital tools (and how these may be combined) increase. Therefore, the approach taken is to use a somewhat more general wording for learning outcomes at Advanced and Highly Advanced levels than learning outcomes at the Basic and Intermediate levels. This is in line with stakeholders’ and experts’ recommendations to focus more on the lower proficiency levels.

The learning outcomes are relatively balanced across Knowledge (42%, 217) and Skills (38%, 199), with a lower percentage related to Attitudes (20%, 107).

Each learning outcome has a unique ID. The ID starts with ‘LO’ to distinguish it from competence statements in Section 3 (those ones start with ‘CS’) and includes the competence number. For example, the IDs of the 21 learning outcomes for Competence 1.1 are LO1.1.01 to LO1.1.21.

The numbering of the competence statements (Section 3) and the learning outcomes (in this Annex) do not correspond, since there are more learning outcomes than competence statements. For example, the content of CS1.1.08 does not correspond to LO1.1.08.

A set of suggested steps for using DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes is shown in Box A2.

Box A2: Suggested steps and readings for implementing DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes.

The steps below are suggestions that could be adapted for specific uses of DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes.

Identify the purpose of using the learning outcomes – particularly if the use will require looking at all of them or a subset. For example, if considering the development or revision of a basic digital competence course, users can immediately exclude Advanced and Highly Advanced levels. Or, if using the learning outcomes to develop professional digital profiles or role descriptions for a specific job, one could filter out learning outcomes for competences that are not relevant in order to focus the work on the ones that are.

Identify who needs to be involved, and at which stages. Experience in of DigComp users and Cedefop’s work on learning outcomes show that an initiative involving learning outcomes is more likely to be successful and impactful if all relevant stakeholders are included at the right stages and for the appropriate purposes.

Early in the project, review the DigComp 3.0 framework so that those involved are familiar with it.

Make a translation of the learning outcomes and other parts of the framework, as needed, referring to the Glossary to ensure that the terms are consistent with local language and use context.

Adapt the learning outcomes to the particular purpose. The DigComp 3.0 framework – including the learning outcomes – is generic by design, so it is almost certain that adaptations will be needed. Adaptations can take many forms – re-wording or elaborating learning outcomes, removing irrelevant learning outcomes, or adding new learning outcomes to cover topics that are relevant to the initiative. If the use involves the development of teaching and learning activities, ‘unplugged’ activities could be considered (e.g. Li et al., 2022).

As noted in Section 2.5, DigComp 3.0 includes intended, not achieved learning outcomes. If the initiative involves the development of achieved learning outcomes, the approach to measurement merits consideration. On one hand, if a strictly empirical approach is used, there is a risk that ‘softer’ or more difficult-to-measure competences would be undervalued or omitted. Learning outcomes that cannot be directly or easily observed or measured are likely to be as important as those that can. A balanced and context-sensitive approach to this issue has been recommended (Cedefop, 2022; Europass Project Group, 2024).",""

For example, percentage coverage of learning outcomes by competence and proficiency level can give transparency, trust and credibility to an initiative. More generally, it is good practice to document adaptations to suit the particular purpose.

Some of the learning outcomes, as well as the competence descriptions for the proficiency levels shown in Section 3, are labelled as AI-explicit or AI-implicit (see Section 2.6). It is recommended to consider AI-related learning outcomes holistically within the overall framework.

Suggested reading:

̊ Cedefop’s (2022) Defining, writing and applying learning outcomes – A European Handbook (second edition) is for individuals and institutions involved in defining and writing learning outcomes. It offers concrete examples and provides an overview of existing guidance and research. Cedefop (2024c) has also developed a dataset of guidance material.

̊ International Test Commission and Association of Test Publishers’ (2022) Guidelines for technology-based assessment (version 1.1) provides guidance and best practices for the design, delivery, scoring, and use of digital assessments, covering topics such as validity, fairness, accessibility, security, and privacy.

The call was targeted to existing users of the DigComp framework in formal, informal and non-formal learning contexts, including assessment and certification, in a European, national, regional or local initiative. The call sought information on initiatives that provided examples of learning outcomes (or similar) developed on the basis of DigComp. In all, 50 submissions were received from 16 countries (Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine) and three European-level organisations. The submission were reviewed against the submission criteria (covering three or more of the five competence areas; link competences to proficiency; and developed since 2018), and divided into Highly relevant (16); Quite relevant (14); Somewhat relevant (11); and Out of scope (9) categories – giving a higher relevance rating to initiatives based on DigComp 2.2 and which contained learning outcomes or equivalents.

The learning outcome statements were extracted from the 16 Highly relevant submissions (which came from nine EU countries and two European-level organisations) and formatted and merged into a single dataset, which we refer to here as the ‘learning outcomes dataset’. Where needed, submissions were translated from their source languages to English using the European Commission’s eTranslation tool. In all, 2,488 learning outcomes were extracted.

A ‘foundation’ set of 386 learning outcomes which were compiled from the 304 examples from Dimension 4 and Annexes 2 and 3 of DigComp 2.2 (Vuorikari et al., 2022a) and the 72 items from the DigComp Self-Assessment Tool (DigCompSAT) item bank (Clifford et al., 2020) was then added to the learning outcomes dataset.

The content of the Quite relevant and Somewhat relevant submissions was then reviewed and checked against the learning outcomes dataset. Where a key

concept or skill was not covered in the learning outcomes dataset, but relevant to include, a learning outcome was drafted to cover it. This resulted in the addition of 43 learning outcome statements to the learning outcomes dataset, which

at that stage consisted of 2,917 learning outcome statements classified by competence area, competence and proficiency level.",""

The secure AI system of the JRC (GPT@JRC), model GPT 4.0 Turbo was used to obtain an initial output, with each change recommended in the output subject to (human) review and either implemented or rejected. Then, the learning outcomes dataset was processed, competence by competence, to eliminate duplicates and to ‘smooth’ variations in writing style and granularity. The secure AI system of the JRC (GPT@JRC), model GPT 4.0 Turbo was again used to obtain a refined output which was extensively reviewed and refined by (humans at) the JRC. Following this, Knowledge, Attitude and Skill classifications were manually assigned to each learning outcome, and further checks were made for consistency across competences. This set was then subjected to a gap analysis using information from the literature and policy review, described next. The process for this work required continual multi-way iterations across competences and proficiency levels, as well as competence areas, to help ensure overall framework coherence.",""

Sources were identified through the more traditional literature search (prioritising systematic reviews and high-quality sources) as well as through targeted reviews of the grey literature (e.g., ERASMUS+ project documentation, policy reports). The purpose of this review was not to be exhaustive but rather to obtain sufficient relevant and high-quality information to combine with the learning outcomes dataset in preparation for expert review in Phase 2.

Sources were grouped into broad themes, and a gap analysis between their contents and the learning outcomes dataset was carried out. Here, ‘gap analysis’ refers to an assessment of text that was extracted from the sources in the scoping review (concepts, competences, learning outcomes,etc.). Each text extract was first assessed to see if it fit the broad, transversal nature of DigComp and thematic priorities of DigComp 3.0. If so, it was then reviewed against the learning outcomes dataset to check whether or not the concept or skill represented by each text extract was included. If not, the content was incorporated through the drafting of a new learning outcome statement. Illustrative examples of the 100 or so sources consulted in the scoping review are shown in Table A6.

The output of Phase 1 consisted of a draft set of 565 learning outcomes, accompanied by a paper describing how they had been constructed and some initial proposals for DigComp 3.0 priorities.

Experts were identified such that the combined group represented geographic and stakeholder diversity (i.e. covering stakeholders across Europe from policy, academia, formal and informal education and training, employers, employment intermediaries and industry), as well as a balance by level (European, national, regional) and gender. The work with experts took place in two steps. In Step 1 (June-December 2024), ICF-Europe, supported by Stefano Kluzer, Lidija Kralj and Riina Vuorikari, coordinated two online expert meetings in June and October 2024. Including the aforementioned experts, 29 individuals from 12 EU countries and six European-level organisations and a diversity of sectors (formal education, vocational and adult education, higher education, employment and third sector) took part.

In these early discussions, participants strongly favoured the prioritisation of policy concerns such as cybersecurity risk, threats to wellbeing, and threat of misinformation to democratic processes; and noted that data protection concerns are now on a bigger scale. Discussions on the draft learning outcomes identified improvements to the wording, and varying views were expressed on the level of granularity and their distribution across proficiency levels. Experts recommended a stronger focus in the learning outcomes on ethical and human-centric aspects.

Following this, the JRC compiled feedback from the experts to revise and improve the learning outcomes and to draft a set of proposed updates to the existing DigComp 2.2 framework. These proposals consisted of changing the wording of certain competence areas and competences; updating the proficiency levels and focusing on four rather than eight levels; systematically integrating AI; and a proposal for a new element, learning goals, which would sit mid-way between general proficiency level descriptions and learning outcomes.

During the second meeting (October 2, 2024), experts reviewed an internal paper drafted by the JRC with proposals for DigComp 3.0. and the revised learning outcomes They confirmed the added value of both the learning outcomes (which had been reduced from 565 to 537), and the learning goals, but flagged that the term ‘learning goals’ might be too close in meaning to ‘learning outcomes’. Experts also made several specific suggestions on the framework content and identified a small number of gaps (such as e-government and AI systems bias identification). The proposal the proficiency levels was supported, with some suggestions to improve wording. Experts recommended the incorporation of recent and emerging trends in such a way as to recognise their implications (e.g. of generative AI in content creation) while at the same time remaining technology-neutral and sufficiently generic for framework stability. They also made some suggestions on ways to support use of the framework, particularly for assessment, and to help users navigate the new added complexity of the framework.

In the final part of Step 1, ICF-Europe and Riina Vuorikari produced an internal summary report that provided options and recommendations for the next steps of development. Recommendations included:

This phase overlapped with Phases 3 and 4, since the experts were centrally involved in the stakeholder consultation and the validation workshop. One expert, Luis Pereira, was assigned the role of Chair of the DigComp expert pool and ensured that all expert observations and feedback were synthesised effectively. A second, Stefano Kluzer, had specific tasks in Phase 3 as Stakeholder Expert. The other five experts were Ulrike Domany-Funtan, Māra Jākobsone, Lidija Kralj, Attila Rausch and Roland Stürz.

Step 2 was an intensive phase of the development of DigComp 3.0, and included seven meetings between the experts and the JRC. The first task of experts was to make an in-depth review of the draft DigComp 3.0 components, which had been revised by the JRC following the feedback and recommendations from

Step 1 of Phase 2. At this stage, the ‘learning objectives’ of the draft framework were re-shaped to become competence statements at each proficiency level. The experts’ review of this enabled the JRC to prepare the materials for the DigComp 3.0 stakeholder consultation sessions in April 2025. Experts each attended one of the two stakeholder sessions and provided their observations to the Chair, who made a synthesis of them. The Stakeholder Expert collaborated with the JRC to design and co-ordinate the consultation sessions and worked with the JRC to produce an internal stakeholder consultation report that considered all stakeholder and experts’ feedback. Experts also supported the JRC’s preparations for the DigComp 3.0 validation workshop in June 2025 and supported the group discussions. A week after the validation workshop, the experts met with the JRC to discuss and agree, concretely, on how the validation workshop feedback would be reflected in the final version of the framework. During this phase, the draft AI Literacy Framework developed in an OECD-European Commission collaboration (OECD, 2025) was reviewed to ensure that the competences of AI literacy were adequately and appropriately present in DigComp 3.0.

Phase 3, which ran from March-May 2025, entailed a broad and structured consultation process. In addition to the stakeholder consultation described here, the JRC liaised with various European Commission Policy Directorates to ensure policy alignment of DigComp 3.0. The Policy Directorates involved are listed in the Acknowledgements.

AIMS, FORMAT AND PARTICIPANTS

An external stakeholder consultation process was carried out in April 2025, aimed at reaching a wide and balanced range of stakeholders (by sector, country, and DigComp experience), and designed to permit efficient and detailed stakeholder feedback to be gathered and synthesised. The consultation process was set up under three streams:

Two 90-minute online consultation sessions, which took place on April 10 and 11. A short background document with the proposed changes for DigComp 3.0 was sent in advance to registered participants. Each online session had the same format, covering rationale, priorities, and proposed changes to DigComp 3.0; and asking stakeholders to provide feedback through open- and closed-format polling questions and the meeting chat function. The DigComp expert pool members each attended one of the two sessions and provided their observations to the Chair, who provided a summary to the JRC. The DigComp Stakeholder Expert designed and coordinated the stakeholder consultation with the JRC, and moderated the sessions.

An optional online feedback survey structured on the same themes of the online consultation, consisting of both open (text) and closed (numeric) responses. A link to this survey was sent to all registered participants (including those who could not attend the online sessions) along with the background document and left open for responses until April 30.

An optional in-depth review of the competence-specific proficiency levels, the proposed way of conveying AI for each competence, and the learning outcomes, again sent to all registered participants, and open until April 30.

In total, 527 stakeholders registered to take part in the consultation. Of these, approximately 260 attended one of the online stakeholder consultation sessions in April. A total of 174 stakeholders submitted a response to the feedback survey, and 40 completed the in-depth review.",""

One-seventh (14%) of registered stakeholders were from outside the EU (either from another European country, 6%, or a non-European one, 8%). Participation across countries was uneven: proportionally more stakeholders from Belgium, Italy and Spain registered to take part. However, stakeholders in Italy and Spain have already made extensive use of DigComp, so high participation was expected. Also, 63% of registered stakeholders in Belgium represented organisations at international or European levels.

About two-fifths of stakeholders represented national perspectives (37%), while 44% were working at European (22%) or international (22%) levels. The remainder were working at regional (11%) or local levels (8%).

The four most common stakeholder groups were higher education leaders, educators and researchers (25%); governmental authorities (including public administration and public organisations) (18%); third sector organisations (12%) and primary and secondary education leaders and educators (11%). Adult and lifelong learning providers (9%), business sector organisations (9%) and VET leaders and educators (5%), accounted for a further 23% of all registered stakeholders. Public and private employment services (2%) and skills certification providers (2.5%) were less frequent, and the remaining 7% of respondents classified themselves as ‘other stakeholder type’.

Most stakeholders (70%) had used DigComp previously, and 15% had participated in the DigComp 2.2 update.

FEEDBACK

Below is a summary of the key findings from the stakeholder feedback analysis. The detailed feedback provided, particularly in the survey and in-depth review, was analysed in depth by the DigComp Stakeholder Expert and the JRC and incorporated into the revisions to the framework for Phase 4.

Overall, stakeholder feedback provided strong support for the identified priority themes, the approach to AI competence, the proficiency levels, and the JRC’s plans for publication. There was also strong support for the new learning outcomes – with 90% of stakeholders agreeing that they added value.

Priority themes: Stakeholders expressed strong support for the five priority themes. Some other themes consistently emerged: (Below-) Basic skills, ethics, inclusion, and the action-oriented (as opposed to passive) wording. These other themes were further considered Phase 4.",""

However, a minority suggested that AI competence should be considered as a separate area. Given the importance of maintaining continuity between DigComp 2.2 and DigComp 3.0, having a separate ‘module’ on AI competence was not seen as a practical option. Stakeholders suggested that the presentation and illustration of AI in DigComp

3.0 needed to be refined. This issue was considered in detail in Phase 4.

Proficiency levels: Overall support for the proposed new proficiency levels was high. However, the proposed change in focus from 8 to 4 levels caused difficulties for stakeholders who currently use the 8-level approach. Additionally, some stakeholders used a 6-level interpretation of the proficiency levels. A proposal for a backwards mapping of DigComp 3.0 to the eight levels in previous iterations of the framework was established by the JRC in response to stakeholder feedback and considered in Phase 4.

Supports for implementation: A large majority of stakeholders considered the following supports for implementation as very useful or essential: A PDF version of the framework; a Glossary of terms and definitions; a machine-readable supplement of the tabular content; updates to the DigComp webspace (currently managed by the JRC); framework accessibility; and guidance documentation.

There was low interest in a hardcopy version of the framework. Discussions at the validation workshop (Phase 4) reinforced these views.

Tailoring and adapting and maintaining relevance: External stakeholders’ commentary frequently touched on the need to tailor and adapt the framework. For example, there were requests for child-friendly and educator versions of the framework. While it would not be feasible for the JRC to make multiple versions of DigComp 3.0 tailored to specific groups, the availability of the framework in

multiple formats enables its tailoring and adaptation to a wide variety of purposes.",""

The main activity of Phase 4 consisted of a face-to-face validation workshop in Seville, Spain on June 17 (afternoon) and June 18 (all day). The objectives of the workshop were to achieve broad consensus on the draft DigComp 3.0 framework, and to identify final steps that were needed prior to its publication.

AIMS, FORMAT AND PARTICIPANTS

The workshop was attended by 34 external participants from 18 countries (17 EU countries and the USA) from a range of sectors (policymaking, employer representatives, adult learning and VET, compulsory education, and academia/ research); and 12 internal (European Commission) participants, from the JRC, DG EMPL, DG CNECT and SG REFORM. Similar to the experts involved in Phase 1, the participants in the validation workshop were identified to represent geographic and stakeholder diversity, as well as a balance across genders and European, national and regional perspectives. The participants included both experts who had participated in Phase 2 as well as individuals who had not been part of the process and who were less familiar with DigComp.

On the afternoon of June 17, participants were presented with an overview of the proposals for the DigComp 3.0 update and a description of the how stakeholder feedback had been incorporated.

On June 18, in the morning, the participants split into four working groups and participated in two 90-minute discussions as follows:

Session 1: Participants discussed the proficiency levels; validated the proposed updates to the competence areas and competences; and reviewed the proposed learning outcomes for four of the 21 competences (1.2, 2.3, 3.4 and 4.3). These four competences selected on the basis of being quite complex or significantly updated compared with DigComp 2.2.

Session 2: Participants discussed the proposed approach to the integration of AI and identified priorities for making the framework clear and usable. Regarding the integration of AI, this included a discussion of the proposal for distinguishing between AI-explicit [AI-E] and AI-implicit [AI-I] competence statements and learning outcomes, and the gathering of suggestions from participants on ways in which to make the published framework clear and easy to use, given the complexities introduced by the changes and the addition of the learning outcomes.

In the afternoon of June 18, working groups reported in plenary on the discussions. Representatives from the Policy Directorates and the DigComp expert pool also provided comments in plenary.",""
