As digital technologies are rapidly evolving, the technology-neutral and flexible nature of DigComp can provide a stable reference point from which to build policy and foster improvements in levels of digital competence. It is hoped its users will continue to raise awareness of the framework and its uses, as well as to encourage and promote its adoption (Centeno & Cosgrove","2025)."","
