and close these gaps and provide opportunities for everyone to build their digital capabilities. Digital competences bring a range of benefits to individuals (such as ability to use public and commercial platforms and services, to broaden
employment and learning opportunities, to foster social connection and civic participation, and to support privacy management and wellbeing in digital environments) (Morte-Nadal & Esteban- Navarro, 2025; Stalmach et al., 2023; Pouliakis et al., 2025; Țarcă et al., 2024), as well as a means to tackle social exclusion (Boerkamp et

digcomp.text.introduction.introduction.01,"In response to the digital transformation and its implications for digital economy and society, the EU undertakes a range of actions and initiatives. Box 1 outlines some of the key ones.
See, for example, the discussion in European Commission (2023b), pp. 50-51.
Box 1. Some key European policy initiatives related to digital competence.
The Digital Decade Policy Programme sets out objectives and targets for Europe’s digital transformation towards 2030. In 2023, only 56% of adults in Europe had at least basic digital skills (European Commission, 2025a). The European Pillar of
Social Rights includes principles related to education, training and lifelong learning. It is accompanied by a European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan (2021) which sets a target of 60% of adults participating in education and training every year by 2030. In 2022, this figure stood at 47%.
The Union of Skills (European Commission, 2025b) is an overarching strategy which aims to ensure that everyone in Europe is empowered to build solid skills foundations and engage in lifelong upskilling and reskilling. It includes an Action  Plan for Basic Skills (European Commission, 2025c) to address declining levels of basic skills (DigComp 3.0 is one of its actions), a STEM Education Strategic Plan (European Commission, 2025d), and a 2030 Roadmap on the future of digital",
digcomp.text.introduction.introduction.02,"education and skills based on a review of the European Digital Education Action Plan (DEAP) (European Commission, 2020, under which DigComp 2.2, the fourth edition of DigComp, was completed).
The Guide to EU Citizenship (European Commission, 2023c) contains information on rights and opportunities associated with being a citizen of the EU, many of which require at least a basic level of digital competence to access and avail of.
The European Commission’s commitment to safer digital environments for all citizens, in particular minors and youth, is evident in the European Strategy for  a Better Internet for Kids (BIK+) (2022), which aims to ensure that children are protected, respected and empowered online. Other initiatives include an EU-wide
inquiry on the broader impacts of social media on wellbeing and a European Action  Plan Against Cyberbullying.
The European Commission has also published the AI Continent Action Plan (2025) and the Apply AI Strategy (2025) which, alongside other initiatives, aim to promote AI literacy among all workers across sectors and to educate and train the next generation of AI experts (including multidisciplinary profiles), as well as attract European and international AI talent to work in Europe. The Apply AI Strategy encourages the adoption of competence approaches stemming from frameworks such as DigComp. The Commission is also working on an AI literacy framework",
digcomp.text.introduction.introduction.03,"for primary and secondary education with the OECD, the first draft of which was published in May 2025. The AI literacy framework will be finalised in 2026.
Several European digital laws and regulations have been published in recent years. These help to protect the rights of individuals, as well as setting out their responsibilities, along with obligations of the providers of digital products, platforms and services. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2018) sets out principles, conditions and obligations for the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The European Accessibility Act (2025) aims to improve the functioning of the internal market for accessible products and services, including computers and operating systems, smartphones, banking and e-commerce.
The Cyber Resilience Act (2024) protects individual consumers and businesses buying software or hardware products. It introduces mandatory cybersecurity
requirements for the providers of these products. The Digital Markets Act (2022) gives consumers new powers of choice in digital services, data ownership and portability, streamlined access to services, and the right to unbiased search results. The Digital  Services Act (2022) helps to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, including",
digcomp.text.introduction.introduction.04,"the spread of disinformation. It regulates online intermediaries and platforms such as marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms. It ensures user safety, including children,
protects fundamental rights, and creates a fair and open online platform environment. Guidelines for the protection of minors under the Digital Services Act have also been published by the European Commission.
The AI Act (2024) addresses risks to individuals’ health, safety, and fundamental rights in relation to AI systems. It provides developers and deployers with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI, while reducing administrative and financial burdens for businesses to facilitate innovation. It bans the use of AI
systems that are incompatible with European values, while imposing requirements on AI systems that are classified as ‘high risk’. For all providers and deployers of AI systems, Article 4 of the AI Act mandates to ensure a sufficient level of AI literacy among the staff and persons dealing with the systems on their behalf. To support the
implementation of Article 4, the Commission has published a Q&A and a repository of AI literacy practices from companies and public sector organisations.",

Europe and beyond in employment, education and training contexts (Centeno et al., 2024b; Centeno & Cosgrove, 2025, Kluzer et al., 2020), and forms the conceptual basis of the Digital Skills Indicator (DSI) (Vuorikari et al., 2022b), which is used to monitor the level of basic digital skills in Europe through the Digital Decade Policy Programme.
As well as providing a common understanding of digital competence, DigComp is used to guide European, national and regional policies; develop assessments; enhance transparency or comparability of education and training courses; recognise or validate learning (such as through digital skills certification); and define profiles
of digital competence in specific jobs or roles, amongst others.",
digcomp.text.introduction.introduction.01,"DigComp 3.0, the fifth edition of the framework,4 continues to be the key reference framework for digital competence in the EU. Digital competence is one of the eight key competences of the Council  Recommendation on key competences for lifelong  learning (European Commission, 2006; 2018).
Key competences are knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed by all for personal fulfilment and development, employability, social inclusion and active citizenship.
DigComp 3.0 embodies the values of the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (European Commission, 2023a) which promotes a human-centric vision of the digital transformation.5 It is organised into six themes (see
Figure 2). The Declaration builds on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (European Commission, 2012).6
Figure 2. The six themes of the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles (2023).
People at the centre
Digital technologies should protect people’s rights, support democracy, and ensure that all digital players act responsibly and safely. The EU promotes these values around the world.
Solidarity and inclusion
Technology should unite, not divide, people. Everyone should have access to the internet, to digital skills, to digital public services, and to fair working conditions.
Freedom of choice",
digcomp.text.introduction.introduction.02,"People should benefit from a fair online environment, be safe from illegal and harmful content, and be empowered when they interact with new and evolving technologies like artificial intelligence.
Participation
Citizens should be able to engage in the democratic process at all levels and have control over their own data.
Safety and security
The digital environment should be safe and secure. All users, from childhood to old age, should be empowered and protected.
Sustainability
Digital devices should support sustainability and the green transition. People need to know about the environmental impact and energy consumption of their devices.

Box 2 provides some notes and definitions on the proficiency levels to guide interpretation and use. Table A3 in Annex 1 shows how these four proficiency
levels can be ‘mapped’ to the more granular eight-level structure of the previous version of DigComp that is used in some contexts (e.g., assessment, certification), as well as to a six-level scheme adopted by some users of the framework.

The approach to the DigComp proficiency levels is inspired by the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) (Carretero et el., 2017). Nonetheless, the ‘levels’ of the EQF do not mean the same as the ‘levels’ of DigComp proficiency. For example, a naïve mapping between the EQF (or a National Qualifications Framework (NQF)) and DigComp could suggest that primary school children (EQF Level 1) would need only",
digcomp.text.digcomp_3_0_framework_components.digcomp_3_0_framework_components.content_creation.02,"Basic-level DigComp competences. However, many children may reach Intermediate or even Advanced levels for some competences, depending on their stage of development and curricular aims. Some countries (e.g. Digital Austria, 2024), have mapped DigComp to an NQF.
While Highly Advanced digital competence in DigComp 3.0 is relevant to ICT specialists (i.e. many ICT specialist roles can benefit from Highly Advanced DigComp competences), they are not the same as ICT specialist skills. ICT specialists are workers who have the ability to develop, operate and maintain ICT systems, for whom ICT constitute the main part of their job (Eurostat, 2025), and typically require specialised training. Eurostat provides a list of occupations which are classified as ICT specialists.

These form the foundations of other competences, such as critical thinking and creativity, which are essential for participation in society, democratic life and the economy and/or labour market. The importance of basic digital skills for all individuals is also acknowledged by the United Nations (UN) Global Digital Compact (GDC), the first comprehensive
framework for global digital governance agreed by UN Member States in 2024, which aims to foster an inclusive, open, safe and secure digital space that respects, protects and promotes human rights.
Several pre-requisites must be in place for an individual to be able to reach the DigComp 3.0 basic level of digital competence, starting with a level of literacy that is sufficient to decode basic visual, textual and/or audio information. Other pre- requisites include access to a sufficiently fast and stable internet connection; access to one or more suitable digital devices to connect to the internet which have the applications required by the user; to technical assistance, where needed; and to appropriate guidance and support, if needed, to adapt devices and settings to individual physical, cognitive or psychological needs (ITU, 2022).",

Achieved learning outcomes are what an individual is able to demonstrate after completion of a learning process. They are related to practice and are the result of an education or training and assessment process (Cedefop, 2022).
Learning outcomes are an important policy and practical tool. Used well, they act as the ‘glue’ that joins education and training with labour market contexts (Cedefop, 2024a). They influence policy, education, training, assessment and the labour market in a range of ways – to
guide curriculum or course content development, implementation and revision; as a reference point for the recognition and validation of formal, non- formal and informal learning; to define and inform qualifications frameworks and standards; to support summative and formative assessment; to signal key employment skills in occupational profiling; and to contribute to sectoral needs analysis (Cedefop, 2017, 2022, 2024a).

2.2 to systematically include the aspects of AI competence that are relevant for individuals to develop as part of their digital competence. AI competence is intertwined with and builds on other elements of digital competence, as AI systems are widely diffused, and increasingly embedded within existing digital technologies. In DigComp 3.0, AI is framed as one digital technology among a range of digital technologies, while keeping the focus on the digital competences themselves.
Several definitions and analyses of AI literacy have been proposed, from the literature (e.g. Touretzky et al. 2019, 2023; Long & Magerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021); legislation (the 2024 AI Act, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689); recent AI literacy frameworks (e.g. OECD, 2025; Mills et al., 2024; UNESCO, 2024); and
policy reports (e.g. Miao et al., 2022; Di Vinadio et al., 2022). These various sources emphasise
conceptual understanding of what AI is (and is not), contexts for its application, and critical, ethical and responsible approaches to using AI. These features are reflected in DigComp 3.0.
To ensure that AI competence is well-integrated in DigComp 3.0, the JRC, with experts, has undertaken a review of recent and emerging digital technology trends and a mapping between the competences of the (draft) European Commission-OECD AI literacy framework (OECD, 2025) and DigComp 3.0 (see Annex 3 for more detail).",
digcomp.text.digcomp_3_0_framework_components.digcomp_3_0_framework_components.content_creation.02,"In DigComp 3.0, we define AI as per the AI Act (Article 3(1)):
In DigComp 3.0, the terms ‘AI’ and ‘AI system’ are used in their broad sense and include generative AI (systems). However, reference to generative AI in DigComp 3.0 is made when it is considered to be of central relevance to a competence. In DigComp
3.0, generative AI is defined as a subset of AI that uses specialised machine learning models designed to produce a wide and general variety of outputs, capable of a range of tasks and applications, such as generating text, image or audio (Abendroth-Dias et al., 2025).
Competence statements (in Section 3) which explicitly mention AI systems are labelled ‘[AI-E]’ (AI-explicit), while those for which AI or AI systems are implicitly relevant but that do not explicitly mention AI systems are labelled ‘[AI-I]’ (AI-implicit). Similarly, individual learning outcomes (Annex 2) are labelled as being AI-Explicit, AI-Implicit, or AI not Implicit or Explicit.
See the Guidelines on the definition of an artificial intelligence system for more details (European Commission, 2025f).
Box 3 provides more information on the meaning of AI-explicit and AI-implicit in DigComp 3.0.

Of the 523 learning outcomes in DigComp 3.0 (Annex 2), 13% (69) are AI-explicit, 63% (330) are AI-implicit, and 24% (124) do not implicitly or explicitly feature AI.
AI competence features explicitly, implicitly, or both, across all 21 competences. This demonstrates the transversal impact of AI systems on digital competence. The aspects of competences which do not explicitly or implicitly feature AI are those involving digital technologies other than AI or which are inherently ‘human’, requiring attributes such as choice, preferences or situational judgement.
AI labelling of competence statements in Section 3 and learning outcomes in Annex 2 as AI-explicit or AI-implicit is intended as a broad guide only.
AI-explicit or [AI-E] means that AI systems are explicitly relevant to that competence.
Meanwhile, AI-implicit or [AI-I] applies to competences for one or more of four reasons. The competence statement or learning outcome could:
Involve the use of AI systems as one of several available digital technologies
Example (see Section 3, Competence statement 2.2.08): A person is trying to decide whether or not to use an AI system for a content creation task. To do so, they need to establish what output is desired and consider the added benefits of using an AI system over another digital technology.",
