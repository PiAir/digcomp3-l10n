It describes knowledge, skills and attitudes that are needed to be digitally competent for daily life, participation in society, working and learning, and can be used with both children and adults. The framework is technology-neutral and is designed to be tailored and adapted for a variety of purposes in education, training and employment contexts. DigComp is intended for individuals and organisations, whether local, regional, national, European or international, which share the common goal of understanding and identifying digital competence needs and supporting their development. It supports EU policies and initiatives on digital skills (such as the Union of Skills, where DigComp is explicitly mentioned, and the Digital Decade Policy Programme) and the societal and economic implications of the digital transformation (such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Kids). DigComp 3.0 incorporates digital technological developments, trends and practices that have occurred since 2022, and which have wide-ranging implications for digital competence. It also includes a new section outlining learning outcomes which provides a more granular view of digital competence that allows easy and consistent interpretation and application of the framework, as well as the systematic and transversal integration of AI competence across the framework.",""

The European Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) describes what is needed to be digitally competent in today’s society.

As a generic transversal framework, it is non-prescriptive and acts as a starting point from which to develop, update, or evaluate initiatives that support the development of digital competence. In Europe, there is a clear need to prioritise digital competence. In 2023, only 56% of EU adults had at least basic digital skills, falling short of the 80% target set for 2030.

Rationale: Protecting is replaced by Supporting to convey a balanced and optimistic (but not naïve) perspective. ‘Wellbeing’ is understood in DigComp 3.0 to include physical, mental and social aspects, so Health is removed from the title.

To be able to avoid health risks and threats to physical and psy- chological wellbeing minimise risks and threats to physical, mental and social wellbeing of oneself and others while using digital technol- ogies.

To be aware of digital technologies for social wellbeing and social inclusion.
Rationale: Using digital technologies in ways that support (rather than negatively affect) wellbeing and inclusion is added to convey the potential benefits of balanced and informed usage. Total avoidance of risks and threats to wellbeing may be unrealistic – this is replaced with minimising risks and threats, and not only to oneself but to others.
