doc.front.abstract.u0004,"DigComp 3.0 is the fifth edition of the European Digital Competence Framework. It describes knowledge, skills and attitudes that are needed to be digitally competent for daily life, participation in society, working and learning, and can be used with both children and adults. The framework is technology-neutral and is designed",,front.abstract | paragraph
doc.front.abstract.u0005,"to be tailored and adapted for a variety of purposes in education, training and employment contexts. DigComp is intended for individuals and organisations, whether local, regional, national, European or international, which share the common goal",,front.abstract | paragraph
doc.front.abstract.u0006,"of understanding and identifying digital competence needs and supporting their development. It supports EU policies and initiatives on digital skills (such as the Union of Skills, where DigComp is explicitly mentioned, and the Digital Decade Policy Programme) and the societal and economic implications of the digital transformation (such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Kids). DigComp 3.0 incorporates digital technological developments, trends and practices that have occurred since 2022, and which have wide-ranging implications for digital competence. It also includes a new section outlining learning outcomes which provides a more granular view of digital competence that allows easy and consistent interpretation and application of the framework, as well as the systematic and transversal integration of AI competence across the framework.",,front.abstract | paragraph

Rationale: Protecting is replaced by Supporting to convey a balanced and optimistic (but not naïve) perspective. ‘Wellbeing’ is understood in DigComp 3.0 to include physical, mental and social aspects, so Health is removed from the title.

To be aware of digital technologies for social wellbeing and social inclusion.
Rationale: Using digital technologies in ways that support (rather than negatively affect) wellbeing and inclusion is added to convey the potential benefits of balanced and informed usage. Total avoidance of risks and threats to wellbeing may be unrealistic – this is replaced with minimising risks and threats, and not only to oneself but to others.

doc.annex2.u1280,"Identify the purpose of using the learning outcomes – particularly if the use will require looking at all of them or a subset. For example, if considering the development or revision of a basic digital competence course, users can immediately exclude Advanced and Highly Advanced levels. Or, if using the learning outcomes to develop professional digital profiles or role descriptions for a specific job, one could filter out learning outcomes for competences that are not relevant in order to focus the work on the ones that are.",,annex2.learning_outcomes | paragraph
doc.annex2.u1281,"Identify who needs to be involved, and at which stages. Experience in of DigComp users and Cedefop’s work on learning outcomes show that an initiative involving learning outcomes is more likely to be successful and impactful if all relevant stakeholders are included at the right stages and for the appropriate purposes.",,annex2.learning_outcomes | paragraph
doc.annex2.u1282,"Early in the project, review the DigComp 3.0 framework so that those involved are familiar with it.",,annex2.learning_outcomes | paragraph
doc.annex2.u1283,"Make a translation of the learning outcomes and other parts of the framework, as needed, referring to the Glossary to ensure that the terms are consistent with local language and use context.",,annex2.learning_outcomes | paragraph
doc.annex2.u1284,"Adapt the learning outcomes to the particular purpose. The DigComp 3.0 framework – including the learning outcomes – is generic by design, so it is almost certain that adaptations will be needed. Adaptations can take many forms – re-wording or elaborating learning outcomes, removing irrelevant learning outcomes, or adding new learning outcomes to cover topics that are relevant to the initiative. If the use involves the development of teaching and learning activities, ‘unplugged’ activities could be considered (e.g. Li et al., 2022).",,annex2.learning_outcomes | paragraph
doc.annex2.u1285,"As noted in Section 2.5, DigComp 3.0 includes intended, not achieved learning outcomes. If the initiative involves the development of achieved learning outcomes, the approach to measurement merits consideration. On one hand, if a strictly empirical approach is used, there is a risk that ‘softer’ or more difficult-to-measure competences would be undervalued or omitted. Learning outcomes that cannot be directly or easily observed or measured are likely to be as important as those that can. A balanced and context-sensitive approach to this issue has been recommended (Cedefop, 2022; Europass Project Group, 2024).",,annex2.learning_outcomes | paragraph
doc.annex2.u1286,"It is good practice to be transparent about how DigComp 3.0 learning outcomes have been used or adapted.

For example, there were requests for child-friendly and educator versions of the framework. While it would not be feasible for the JRC to make multiple versions of DigComp 3.0 tailored to specific groups, the availability of the framework in",,annex3.phases | paragraph

doc.annex3.u3593,"The workshop was attended by 34 external participants from 18 countries (17 EU countries and the USA) from a range of sectors (policymaking, employer representatives, adult learning and VET, compulsory education, and academia/ research); and 12 internal (European Commission) participants, from the JRC, DG EMPL, DG CNECT and SG REFORM. Similar to the experts involved in Phase 1, the participants in the validation workshop were identified to represent geographic and stakeholder diversity, as well as a balance across genders and European, national and regional perspectives.

Feedback and observations were provided by the DigComp expert pool following guidance provided by the JRC, and synthesised by the expert pool Chair. In the feedback, experts were positive about the diversity of perspectives brought by the participants and praised the level of engagement and quality and depth of discussion. Specific suggestions were systematically categorised by the main themes of competence areas and competences; proficiency levels; learning outcomes; integration of AI competence; and communication/dissemination aspects. Under each theme, specific actions to address the feedback were identified and implemented during the finalisation of DigComp 3.0.",,annex3.phases | paragraph
