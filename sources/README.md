# SOURCES
These are the original source files from the JRC.

* DigComp 3.0 EDITABLE 16 Dec 2025 - bewerkt.docx = cleaned up version of the source docx. The original version contained a lot of images of which the re-use status was unclear (the colophon states that the JRC had not cleared all of the used images for re-use), a lot of extra markup (spaces, line breaks) just for formatting, multiple columns, tables that were not real tables, so this version is the stripped down version of the original so translation is possible.
